# Expectation_Maximization_Algorithm
This is an explanation for the Expectation Maximization Algorithm using Coin Flip example. For more information on EM, MLE and Coin Flip example please read the pdf file. 

The given example is implemented according to the coin toss example given in the Nature Biotechnology article. This example can be optimized to give better results i.e. Theta_A and Theta_B values by updating the miximization step.
